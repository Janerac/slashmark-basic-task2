Welcome to the Fake News Detection repository! This project provides tools and resources for detecting and analyzing fake news articles using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Our goal is to help users identify misinformation and disinformation in textual content efficiently.

Key Features:

- Data Collection: Access scripts and resources for collecting fake news datasets from various sources. dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samridhisuri/newscsv?resource=download

- Text Analysis: Leverage state-of-the-art natural language processing methods to analyze and preprocess textual data. Explore techniques such as tokenization, word embedding, and feature extraction to prepare data for model training.

- Model Development:*Build machine learning models to classify news articles as real or fake. Experiment with different algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines, and deep learning models, to achieve accurate predictions.

- Evaluation:Evaluate the performance of your models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tune model parameters and explore ensemble techniques to enhance performance further.
